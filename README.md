 Data collection chalenge
## Code Source and Location

This project contains code for scraping and analyzing Mars data, using Splinter and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Pandas for data analysis.

- The web scraping scripts can be found in `Module11_Challenge_DATAUCI/part_1_mars_news.ipynb` and `Module11_Challenge_DATAUCI/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`  files.
- Data analysis and visualization code can be found in the `Module11_Challenge_DATAUCI/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
- All processed data is saved to a CSV file, `mars_data.csv`, located in the `data` directory.

The code was developed for a data analysis project that involves scraping Mars news, temperature and atmospheric data, analyzing the information, and presenting it visually using Matplotlib.
